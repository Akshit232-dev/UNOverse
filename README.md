## 1. Anagram Detection
A string manipulation problem that introduces character frequency analysis and comparison.

Given **two strings**, determine if they are **anagrams** while ignoring case and spaces. Two strings are anagrams if they contain exactly the same characters with the same frequency, regardless of their order.

**Your task:** Determine if the two given strings are anagrams of each other, ignoring case and spaces.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
String1: "listen"
String2: "silent"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

---

**Input:**
```
String1: "hello"
String2: "world"
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

---

**Input:**
```
String1: "The Eyes"
String2: "They See"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

## 2. Merge Sort Algorithm Design
A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts arrays through recursive merging.

Design an algorithm to sort an array of **n** elements in ascending order using the **Merge Sort technique**. Merge Sort works by dividing the array into smaller subarrays, sorting them recursively, and then merging them back together in sorted order.

This problem teaches you about **divide-and-conquer algorithms**, **recursion**, and **efficient sorting techniques** with O(n log n) time complexity.

**Your task:** Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.

### Specifications

**Input:**
```
Array of n elements
```
**Output:**
```
Sorted array in ascending order
```

## 3. Odd/Even Detection Code Golf
A mathematical problem that challenges you to determine number parity using minimal code without conditionals.

Given an **integer**, determine whether it is **odd or even** without using conditional statements **(if else)**, in the most concise code possible. This is a code golf challenge where the goal is to write the shortest possible solution.

**Your task:** Determine if the given integer is odd or even using the most concise code possible without conditional statements **(if else)**.

### Specifications

**Input:**
```
An integer
```
**Output:**
```
Indication of whether the number is odd or even
```
